# Parallax Effect Design in Figma

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the design of a **parallax scrolling effect** using Figma. The parallax effect creates an engaging and interactive user experience by layering visuals and animating them to move at different speeds during scrolling, creating an illusion of depth.

## 🎨 Features  
- **Multi-layered Design:** Includes multiple layers with different scroll speeds for a realistic parallax effect.  
- **Smooth Animations:** All layers move seamlessly to deliver a visually captivating experience.  
- **Customizable Elements:** Easily replace images, text, or other assets to adapt the design to your project.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for a variety of screen sizes and optimized for smooth scrolling.  

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- **Figma**: Used to design and prototype the parallax effect.  
- **Smart Animate**: Utilized for transitions and scroll-based animations.

## 📂 File Structure  
The project is organized into the following frames:  
1. **Background Layer**: Static or slow-moving background visuals.  
2. **Midground Layer**: Elements that move slightly faster than the background.  
3. **Foreground Layer**: Fast-moving elements to create depth.  
4. **Prototype Flow**: Includes scrolling actions to demonstrate the effect.

## 🛠️ How to Use  
1. Open the Figma file in your Figma account.  
2. Navigate to the **Prototype** tab to view interactions.  
3. Start the presentation mode to see the parallax scrolling in action.  
4. Customize the design by editing text, images, or layer positions as needed.  

## 🌍 Applications
